# EduJourney

## Overview
EduJourney is a mobile application that allows users to review Singapore Educational Institutions and leave comments and ratings for other users of the platform. The platform also provides information of how far a specific school is to your home using the **Google Map**. It was developed using **Unity** and **Firebase**. This program was built by 6 students from Nanyang Technological University in 3 months.

## My Responsibility
I mainly worked on the **back-end** of the application, using Firebase's Realtime Database Service to store information of Singapore Educational institutions into Firebase directly. I also used Firebase's built-in Unity API to retrieve and query the desired information for the front-end that was built using Unity.
